        <p><i>[verbatim]</i> Tuesday the 17th of September. Morning at the hotel in Amsterdam. Good weather. Quite cool.
            Good for, good, for good, for walking. Amsterdam is already beginning to feel like a great little city. One
            You could really live in.
            Cost.
            Perhaps where we are Waterloo Plain is upmarket. I don't know, but it feels really good. Spent a lot of time
            last night reflecting on the chaos that. Eurostar in the morning and it seems to me that that is a public
            health hazard when you consider that each train takes around 1000 passengers and they got 3 train works
            backed up at any given time. You've got 3000 people plus all their luggage, and I'm talking serious volumes
            of luggage congesting every open space in in the in the nearest equivalent in London to the back hole of the
            call.
            So.
            Butter. I'm going to write to the authorities because really, if there was some sort of. Panic. Smoke. Fire.
            Bomb alert. You'd be looking at football stadiums. Type disaster. No visible exit signs that I could see.
            Absolutely unbelievable. Apart from that, train journey was fine. Sleep last night. Was good then the last
            night was good. We're setting off today to the Rights Museum. To see the various bits and pieces by whoever
            it was the night watch Rembrandt. Talk again later. Bye.
