        <p><i>[verbatim]</i> Saturday the 14th of September. We leave from Sherborne station tomorrow at 11:00. I check
            the barometer.
            Gone up through the ceiling. We're in for a period of high pressure. Just when we're leaving. Wonderful golf
            weather. Too bad. 1:00. The house guardian arrives by car. Our dear old friend Janet. She's gonna look
            after the place. Spend the rest of the day re-packing, re-thinking, sorting her out. Well, it's now
            6:00. And we really are ready to go. Dinner at 7. More tomorrow.</p>
