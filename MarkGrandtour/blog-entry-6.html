        <p><i>[verbatim]</i> Wednesday The 18th, still in Amsterdam. Some thoughts on the traffic system of Amsterdam.
            Their priorities are quite clear. First trams, second two wheels of all descriptions, third motor cars and
            4th pedestrians. Basically, the pedestrians just have to look after themselves. Any pedestrian that wanders
            into the wrong space is deadmeat. Being a pedestrian requires constant attention. Second thought is that the
            use of electric bikes will be presumably the introduction of the electric bikes. Has made the whole cycling
            business completely different. They enable cyclists to go, it seems to me, extremely fast. And to be
            extremely aggressive. Taxis fall somewhere between trams. And bicycles. And have to be relatively on the
            ball to work out which particular part of the road to be in. As for driving, well, I'm glad I don't have to
            do it. Getting in lane is a critical factor. Whether you're going straight, turning left or turning right.
            And once you've got, once you've made the decision, there's no going back.
            All buddy Tom.
            Uhm. Taxis. Seemed to have to force their way around the place. As for aggression, well, it seems to me the
            cyclists are extremely aggressive, but their aggression is not taken out of pedestrians who just cower. The
            aggression of cyclists has taken out on each other, but principally against the cause. Motorists have to be
            extremely careful. No cyclists wear helmets as well. That's a good point. Cyclists go seem to have a a war
            of aggression against motors against motorists. And this is something I think we could learn from. In
            planning our systems in London. Because in the end, cyclists think they own the city and to agree in
            Amsterdam they do. They do in London. So much for that keep keep your head down if you're walking.
