        <p><i>[verbatim]</i> Historians exist to write. I could add that they exist to write history, but I'm not so
            sure about that. They exist to write something, some of which they might call history, other bits of which
            could be called well. Fantasy novels, philosophy, even some of them, have called it. Science. Having said
            that, there exists to right. Part of their existence is involved in reading. In fact, I would say the bulk
            of their existence exists in reading, reading other people's history. That's where I find myself at the
            moment. Sitting on the lakes of sitting on the shores of Lake Como, leading other people's history. One is a
            book that I should have read as an undergraduate student. In 1966. AJP Taylor's, the Habsburg monarchy. Of
            course, being a first year undergraduate student, I never did anything other than play games, so of course I
            didn't read it. I'm reading it now. Very appropriate, given that this part of Italy was for many years part
            of the Austrian Empire, but see a JP Taylor's discussion of what it should really be called. The other book
            I'm reading is a book about the Berlin to Baghdad Railway. In pursuit of little bits of history around the
            world. That I haven't really delved into, but should have done being a military historian and also in a
            historian interested in the influence. Of Europe on other parts of the world.
